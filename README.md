## ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to Duhoon's Github!
Exactly, I am developer for Blockchain & DApp.

I was studied in Codestates BEB(Blockchain Engineer Bootcamp) 7th Course.

I am winner in 2023 Glitch Hackathon & 2023 ETH Seoul.

I worked in a blockchain company, Algorith Capital. 
I implemented a aribitrage bot that trade crypto assets between centralized exchanges and decentralized exchanges.
For implementing this bot, I use LogsFilter supported in EVM and search block by this bot to find some transactions I need.
In other work, I developed a logic for calculate statistics within several term like daily, monthly and yearly, using massive blockchain data.

- Interesting about

Ethereum Solidity, and Go.
I am solving algorihtm problem with Golang in Leetcode. It's so exciting!
